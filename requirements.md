# Async Cook Project

This is a reimaging the recipe page for the modern home cook

## Features

- Recipes should fit with a single page app with as much or as little information as the user needs
- Ingredients will be in a tradional list but will also have statuses that change as users go through each step
- Each step is considered the active state with preceding steps shown on the background
- More information about each step will have different categories and are shown in a popup
- It's important to add prep and cleaning as part of the recipe process
- For now, this is a tool for a solo cook with one or more cooking appliances.

## Future features

- Recipes for multiple cooks
- Merges processes for cooks making more than one recipe
