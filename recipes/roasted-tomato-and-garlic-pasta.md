# Roasted Tomato and Garlic Pasta

My spin on a recipe inspired by Kenji Lopez-Alt's quick fresh tomato pasta. Roasting the tomatoes in the over adds additional with less mess. <https://www.seriouseats.com/fast-easy-pasta-blistered-cherry-tomato-sauce-recipe>

## Ingredients

### Roasted tomatoes and garlic

- 340-450g cherry tomatoes
- 3-4 unpeeled cloves of garlic (explaination: peel prevents garlic from burning.)
- 30g extra virgin olive oil
- salt
- black pepper

### Shrimp (optional)

- 120g raw shrimp
- salt
- a pinch of baking soda

### Mozzarella (optional)

- 120g mozzarella cheese

### Pasta

- 150g dried pasta (Recommendation: Most types of dried pasta will work, but be sure to use a pan that will fit your dried pasta of choice easily.)
- 600ml water
- salt (Recommendation: Use just enough to season pasta if you plan to use the pasta water.)

- dried basil (Recommendation: If using fresh basil, chop into smaller pieces.)
- red pepper flakes
- 20g grated Parmasan cheese
- black pepper
- extra virgin olive oil
- salt or fish sauce (Recommendation: Fish sauce pairs well with tomatoes.)

- extra grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)

## Step 1

Wash and cut **cherry tomatoes** in half. Toss tomatoes in bowl with **olive oil**, **salt**, and **black pepper**. Place tomatoes and **garlic** on a parchment-lined baking sheet flesh side up and in a single layer. Roast in an oven set at **450°F** for **25-30 minutes**. (explanation: Parchment paper is non-stick. Putting tomatoes flesh side up prevents the tomato skins from burning. Single layer prevents crowding.)

## Optional Step (shrimp)

Season **raw shrimp** with **salt** and a pinch of **baking soda**. If frozen, thaw under running water for 10 minutes first. (Alert: Use a small amount of baking soda prevents the shrimp from becoming mushy.)

## Optional Step (mozzarella)

Slice **mozzarella**.

## Step 2

Boil **pasta** in **salted water** for **1-2 minutes** before instructions for al dente. Set aside pasta and pasta cooking water. (Explanation: Pasta will finish cooking in during the next step.)

## Optional Step (shrimp) 2

In a pan, heat cooking oil in high heat until smoking. Fry **marinated shrimp** for about **1 minute** until slightly brown. Remove from heat and set aside.

## Step 3

- Remove peel from garlic. Pour **roasted tomatoes and garlic** into pan. Add **basil** and **red pepper flakes** to sauce. Add **cooked pasta** and some of the **cooked pasta water** to pan and stir on high heat.
- Remove pan from heat and add most or all of the **grated Parmesan cheese**.
- Return pan to heat and add **black pepper** and **olive oil** and stir for another **30 seconds**.
- Add **salt** to taste. Add more pasta water to adjust consistency.
- Add **cooked shrimp** to pasta and toss to combine.

## Step 4

Serve pasta with extra **grated Parmesan cheese**, **olive oil**, and extra **black pepper**.

## Optional Step (Mozzerella)

Top pasta with **sliced mozzarella**.
