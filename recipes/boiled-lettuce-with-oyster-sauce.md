# Boiled Lettuce with Oyster Sauce

Based on Lucas Sin's recipe of the same name (https://food52.com/recipes/90179-chinese-style-lettuce-with-garlic-and-oyster-sauce), I added can of tuna in order to make the dish a more complete meal and to help thicken the sauce. Serve with white rice.

## Ingredients

300g Lettuce
1 scallion
3 cloves minced garlic

*For the sauce*
30g oyster sauce
15ml soy sauce
2g sugar

15g neutral cooking oil
1 can chunk light, undrained (context: if using larger cuts of canned tuna, break up tuna into smaller pieces)

1g red pepper flakes
water

1. Wash and chop lettuce into bite sized piece. Wash and chop scallions to rounds. Peel and mince garlic cloves. (context: If serving with rice, wash and cook rice first. Keep rice warm until ready to serve)
2. Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar in a bowl. Set aside.
3. - In a pan, heat up neutral oil over high heat until slightly smoking. Add minced garlic, scallion, and red pepper flakes and fry until aromatic. Add canned tuna and cook until slighty brown
- Add combined sauce to pan. Add water to deglaze pan and to adjust for consistency. Cook until sauce is thickened. Pour sauce out and set aside.
4. In the same pan, boil slightly salted water. Once boiled, add lettuce and cook until leaves turn bright green. Remove from pan and strain.
5. Serve lettuce with sauce drizzled on top.
