# Weekday Rice & Lentils

A dish inspired by the Middle Eastern dish mujadara that is ready as soon as the rice and lentils are done cooking, though it does require attention of two separate pans at the stove.

## Ingredients

### For the rice and lentils

- **150g** brown or green lentils
- **150g** rice (Recommendation: Basmati is traditionally used, but any type of rice will work)
- **448g** water
- **2g** salt
<!---->
- **2** onions (Alert: Because the recipe involves making crispy onions and caramelized onions simultaneously, feel free to skip one of them)
- **1** scallion *(optional)*
<!---->
- extra virgin olive oil
- salt
- water
<!---->
- **2g** cumin seeds
<!---->
## Step 1 — Prep and cook rice and lentils

Combine and wash **lentils** and **rice** until rinsing liquid comes out clear. Combine mixture with **water** and **salt** and add to rice cooker or pressure cooker. Cook in electric pressure cooker for **15 minutes** on high pressure or normal setting in a rice cooker. Natural release if using pressure cooker.

## Step 2 — Chop onions and aromatics

For the *caramelized onions*, peel and **dice** one of the **onions**.

For the *crispy onions*, peel and cut the other onion into **thin slices**.

Slice **scallions** if using

## Step 3 — Steam and cook onions

Background: *Two pans are active*

Place **sliced onions** and **diced onions** in separate pans. Add **olive oil** in each pan and season with **salt**. Add **water** and cover with a lid. Steam each at high heat for **7-10 minutes**.

Explanation: *Add just enough water to cook through the onions before it evaporates*

For *caramelized onions*, once water evaporates from the pan remove the lid, **lower heat to medium** and **add a small amount of water and deglaze** the pan. Repeat the process until onions reach desired sweetness.

For *crispy onions*, once the water evaporates from the pan remove the lid, **lower heat to medium-low**, and **separate each slice from each other**. Cook until desired crispiness and remove onions from the heat.

## Step 4 — Plate the dish

When the caramelized onion is cooked to the desired sweetness, add **cumin seeds** (and **sliced scallions** if using) to pan and cook for another **30 seconds**. Mix **caramelized onions** and cumin to **rice and lentils**. Top the dish with **crispy onions** and the **onion-infused oil**.
