# Weekday Rice and Lentils

A dish inspired by the Middle Eastern dish mujadara that is ready as soon as the rice and lentils are done cooking, though it does require attention of two separate pans at the stove.

## Ingredients

### Rice and lentils

- **150g** of rice (Recommendation: Basmati is traditionally used, but any rice will work)
- **150g** of brown or green lentils
- **448g** water
- **2g** salt

### Yogurt sauce *(optional)*

- **120g** Greek yogurt
- **15ml** lemon juice
- **2g** ground cumin
- **2g** ground coriander
- **2g** dried mint (Recommendation: Use 5g of fresh mint if available)
- lemon zest
- salt

- **2** onions (Alert: Since we are making crispy onions and carmelized onions simultaneously, feel free to drop one or the other)
- **1** scallion *(optional)*
- **2g** cumin seeds
- extra virgin olive oil
- salt
- water

## Step 1 (Prep and cook rice and lentils)

Combine and wash **lentils** and **rice** until rinsing liquid comes out clear. Combine mixture with **water** and **salt** and add to rice cooker or pressure cooker.

## Step 2 (Chop onions and aromatics)

- For the caramelized onions, peel and dice one **onion**.

- For the crispy onions, peel and cut **onion** into thin slices.

- Slice **scallions** if using

## Step 3 (Steam and cook onions)

- Place **sliced onions** and **diced onions** in separate pans, add a tablespoon of **olive oil** each and season with **salt**. Cover onions halfway with **water** and cover with a lid. Steam each at high heat for 7-10 minutes.

- For *caramelized onions*, once water disappears from the pan remove the lid, lower heat to medium, and continuously add small amounts of water and scrape the sides of the pan with a wooden spoon. Do this until rice and lentil or longer

- For *crispy onions*, once the water disappears from the pan remove the lid, lower heat to medium-low, and separate each slice of onion from each. Cook until desired crispiness and remove onions from the heat.

## Step 4 (Plate the dish)

When caramelized  are cooked to the desired sweetness, add **cumin seeds** (and **sliced scallions** if using) to pan and cook for another 30 seconds. Mix **caramelized onions** and cumin to **rice and lentils**. Top the dish with crispy onions and the **onion-infused oil**.
