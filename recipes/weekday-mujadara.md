# Weekday Mujadara

A weekday version of Middle Eastern lentil that is ready as soon as the rice and lentils are done cooking, though it does require attention of two separate pans at the stove.

## Ingredients

### Rice and lentils

- **150g** of rice (Recommendation: Basmati is traditionally used, but any rice will work)
- **150g** of brown or green lentils
- **450g** water
- **1-2g** salt

- **2** onions (Alert: Since we are making crispy onions and carmelized onions simultaneously, feel free to drop one or the other and focus on the other)
- **1** scallion *(optional)*
- **2g** of cumin seeds
- extra virgin olive oil
- salt
- water
- yogurt *(for serving)*

## Step 1 (Prep and cook rice and lentils)

Combine and wash **lentils** and **rice** until rinsing liquid comes out clear. Combine mixture with **water** and **salt** and add to rice cooker or pressure cooker.

## Step 2 (Chop onions and aromatics)

- For the carmelized onions, peel and dice one onion.

- For the crispy onions, peel and cut onion into thin slices.

## Step 3 (Steam and cook onions)

- For both types of onions, place each in a separate pans, add a tablespoon of olive oil each and season with salt. Cover onions halfway with water and cover with a lid. Steam each at high heat for 7-10 minutes.

- For carmelized onions, once water disappears from the pan remove the lid, lower heat to medium, and continuously add small amounts of water and scrape the sides of the pan with a wooden spoon. Do this until rice and lentil or longer

- For crispy onions, once the water disappears from the pan remove the lid, lower head to medium-low, and separate each slice of onion from each. Cook until desired crispiness and remove onions from the heat.

## Step 4 (Plate the dish)

When carmelized are cooked to the desired sweetness, add cumin seeds (and sliced scallions if using) to pan and cook for another 30 seconds. Mix carmelized onions and cumin to rice and lentils. Top the dish with crispy onions and the onion-infused oil. Serve with yogurt if using.
